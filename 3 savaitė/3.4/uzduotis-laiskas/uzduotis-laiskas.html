                <p id="greeting">Dear Jason,</p>
                <div id="content-sections">
                    <p>I’m writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effective August 14, 2020.</p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in early September. I’m tendering my resignation
                        now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. It’s rare to find a customer
                        service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn, as well as such a positive, inspiring team of people
                        to grow and learn with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education. Your support has meant
                        so much to me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.
                    </p>
